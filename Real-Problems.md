## Minimum Swaps to Group All 1's Together

Q: Given a binary array data, return the **minimum** number of swaps required to group all 1â€™s present in the array together in any place in the array.

Eg:

```c++
Input: [1,0,1,0,1]
Output: 1
Explanation: 
There are 3 ways to group all 1 together:
[1,1,1,0,0] using 1 swap.
[0,1,1,1,0] using 2 swaps.
[0,0,1,1,1] using 1 swap.
The minimum is 1.

Input: [0,0,0,1,0]
Output: 0
Explanation: 
Since there is only one 1 in the array, no swaps needed.

Input: [1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1]
Output: 3
Explanation: 
One possible solution that uses 3 swaps is [0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1].
```

Solution: Count all `1` then sliding windows. Time: `O(N)`, Space: `O(1)`

```py
def minSwaps(data):
    # Step 1: Count total number of 1's
    total_ones = sum(data)
    if total_ones == 0:
        return 0

    # Step 2: Initialize the first window
    current_zeros = total_ones - sum(data[:total_ones])
    min_zeros = current_zeros

    # Step 3: Slide the window across the array
    for i in range(total_ones, len(data)):
        current_zeros += data[i - total_ones] - data[i]
        min_zeros = min(min_zeros, current_zeros)
    
    return min_zeros

# Example test cases
print(minSwaps([1,0,1,0,1]))        # Output: 1
print(minSwaps([0,0,0,1,0]))        # Output: 0
print(minSwaps([1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1]))  # Output: 3

```

## Find Greatest Common Divisor of Array

Q: Given an integer array nums, return the **greatest common divisor** of num pairs in `nums`.

Eg:

```c++
Input: [2, 4, 8, 6]
Output: 4
```

Solution: GCD + for each, Time: `O(N^2)`, Space: `O(1)`

```py
def gcd(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a

def findMaxGCD(nums: list[int]) -> int:
    max_gcd = 0
    n = len(nums)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i + 1, n):
            current_gcd = gcd(nums[i], nums[j])
            if current_gcd > max_gcd:
                max_gcd = current_gcd
    return max_gcd
```

Note: If for least common multiple(LCM), `a * b / gcd(a, b)`

## 3Sum

Q: Given an integer array nums, return all the triplets `[nums[i], nums[j], nums[k]]` such that `i != j`, `i != k`, and `j != k`, and `nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] == 0`.

Notice that the solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.

Eg:

```bash
Input: nums = [-1,0,1,2,-1,-4]
Output: [[-1,-1,2],[-1,0,1]]
Explanation: 
nums[0] + nums[1] + nums[2] = (-1) + 0 + 1 = 0.
nums[1] + nums[2] + nums[4] = 0 + 1 + (-1) = 0.
nums[0] + nums[3] + nums[4] = (-1) + 2 + (-1) = 0.
The distinct triplets are [-1,0,1] and [-1,-1,2].

Input: nums = [0,1,1]
Output: []
Input: nums = [0,0,0]
Output: [[0,0,0]]
```

Solution: Sort the array, then double pointers. Time: `O(N^2)`, Space: `O(1)`(Python `.sort()` only `O(1)`, `sorted()` is `O(N)`)

```py
def threeSum(nums: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
    nums.sort()
    result = []
    n = len(nums)

    for i in range(n):
        # Note: we've sorted the nums, so this equal to the global skip
        if i > 0 and nums[i] == nums[i - 1]:
            continue

        left, right = i + 1, n - 1
        
        while left < right:
            total = nums[i] + nums[left] + nums[right]
            if total == 0:
                result.append([nums[i], nums[left], nums[right]])
                # move left and skip duplicate element
                while left < right and nums[left] == nums[left + 1]:
                    left += 1
                while left < right and nums[right] == nums[right - 1]:
                    right -= 1
                left += 1
                right -= 1
            elif total < 0:
                left += 1
            else:
                right -= 1
    return result
```

## Maximum Value at a Given Index in a Bounded Array

Q: You are given three positive integers: n, index, and maxSum. You want to construct an array nums (0-indexed) that satisfies the following conditions:

- nums.length == n
- nums[i] is a positive integer where 0 <= i < n.
- abs(nums[i] - nums[i+1]) <= 1 where 0 <= i < n-1.
- The sum of all the elements of nums does not exceed maxSum.
- nums[index] is maximized.

Return nums[index] of the constructed array.

Eg:

```bash
Input: n = 4, index = 2,  maxSum = 6
Output: 2
Explanation: nums = [1,2,2,1] is one array that satisfies all the conditions.
There are no arrays that satisfy all the conditions and have nums[2] == 3, so 2 is the maximum nums[2].

Input: n = 6, index = 1,  maxSum = 10
Output: 3
```

Solution:

```py
def maxValue(n: int, index: int, maxSum: int) -> int:
    # binary search + math validation
    # Time: O(logN), Space: O(1)
    def calculateSum(x):
        left_count = index
        right_count = n - index - 1
        
        # sum of left
        if x > left_count:
            # x is bigger than count, no need to worry "1"
            sum_left = (x + (x - left_count)) * (left_count + 1) // 2
        else:
            sum_left = (x * (x + 1)) // 2 + (left_count - x + 1)
        
        if x > right_count:
            sum_right = (x + (x - right_count)) * (right_count + 1) // 2
        else:
            sum_right = (x * (x + 1)) // 2 + (right_count - x + 1)
        
        total_sum = sum_left + sum_right - x
        
        return total_sum
    
    # binary search
    low, high = 1, maxSum
    
    while low < high:
        mid = (low + high + 1) // 2
        if calculateSum(mid) <= maxSum:
            low = mid
        else:
            high = mid - 1
    
    return low
```

## Minimum Number of Moves for Towers

Q: You are given an integer array `towers`, where each element represents the height of a tower. You are tasked with adjusting the heights of the towers by adding blocks to make the towers follow a strictly increasing or strictly decreasing stair-step pattern. This means the height of each tower should differ from its neighbors by exactly 1.

To change the height of a tower, you can make multiple moves, each of which adds exactly one block to the top of any tower. Your goal is to determine the minimum number of moves required to make the towers either strictly ascending or strictly descending, whichever requires fewer moves.

Eg:

```bash
Input: `towers = [1, 4, 3, 2]`
Output: 4
Explanation: `[5, 4, 3, 2]`

Input: `towers = [5, 7, 9, 4, 11]`
Output: 9
Explanation: `[7, 8, 9, 10, 11]`
```

Solution: Find the appropriate first element then go. Time: `O(N)`, Space: `O(N)`(temp)

```py
def min_operations(towers: list[int]) -> int:
    n = len(towers)
    if n == 0:
        return 0

    # Find the h0 for ascending array
    h0_inc = max(towers[i] - i for i in range(n))
    total_cost_inc = sum((h0_inc + i - towers[i]) for i in range(n))

    # Find the h0 for descending array
    h0_dec = max(towers[i] + i for i in range(n))
    total_cost_dec = sum((h0_dec - i - towers[i]) for i in range(n))

    return min(total_cost_inc, total_cost_dec)
```

## Longest Segment of Contiguous Houses

Q: You are given an array `queries`, representing the locations of new houses to be built in the order they will be built. After each house is built, your task is to find the longest segment of contiguous houses in the district.

Eg:

```bash
Input: `queries = [2, 1, 3]`
Output `[1, 2, 3]`
Explanation:
Step 1: Build a house at position 2. The longest contiguous segment is `[2]`, which has a length of 1.
Step 2: Build a house at position 1. Now the longest contiguous segment is `[1, 2]`, which has a length of 2.
Step 3: Build a house at position 3. Now the longest contiguous segment is `[1, 2, 3]`, which has a length of 3.

Input: `queries = [1,3,0,4]`
Output: `[1, 1, 2, 2]`
```

Solution: Union-Find. Mark union and expand generally. Time: `O(N)`(Note: `find` is fast since we have Path compression.), Space: `O(N)`

```py
def longest_consecutive_segments(queries: list[int]) -> list[int]:
    parent: dict[int, int] = {}
    size: dict[int, int] = {}
    max_length = 0
    result = []

    def find(x: int) -> int:
        # Path compression
        if parent[x] != x:
            parent[x] = find(parent[x])
        return parent[x]

    def union(x: int, y: int) -> None:
        xroot = find(x)
        yroot = find(y)
        if xroot == yroot:
            return
        # Union by size
        if size[xroot] < size[yroot]:
            parent[xroot] = yroot
            size[yroot] += size[xroot]
        else:
            parent[yroot] = xroot
            size[xroot] += size[yroot]

    for x in queries:
        # Initialize parent and size for the new house
        parent[x] = x
        size[x] = 1

        # Check neighbors
        for neighbor in [x - 1, x + 1]:
            if neighbor in parent:
                union(x, neighbor)

        # Find the root and update max_length
        root = find(x)
        max_length = max(max_length, size[root])
        result.append(max_length)

    return result
```
